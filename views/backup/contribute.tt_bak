<h2>Dance with us</h2>

<p>
Dancer is a modern Perl project, while it's already usable to build small
websites (like this one) it's still in development. There are many ways to contribute.
</p>

<h3>Promote</h3>

<p>
There are many, many frameworks out there, marketing can make a difference.
If you like Dancer, tell the world about it, blog it, tweet it. This is a very
valuable contribution to the project.
</p>

<h3>Use it</h3>

<p>
Of course, using Dancer is the best way to help the project, you will see it
running by yourself, and maybe, you will find something to enhance or will
commit some ideas to the crew.
</p>

<h3>Report bugs</h3>

<p>
So you're using it and you've found a bug, that's great! Yes, Great. Because a
bug found is a bug in the way of being fixed. <a
