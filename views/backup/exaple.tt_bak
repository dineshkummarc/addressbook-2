What's better than showing you how this website is written, isn't that the best
example I could show?

<pre class="prettyprint">
#!/usr/bin/perl
 
use Dancer;
use Template;

get '/' => sub { template 'home' };

# auto_page takes care of rendering each path that has a corresponding template in 
# the views dir (/example, /download, /about ... )

dance;
